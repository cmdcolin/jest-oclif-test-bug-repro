# jest-oclif-test-error-repro

Fails when using jest with oclif after @oclif/core v4.0.20 (works with v4.0.19)

Related to capturing stdout or something like this

This repo adapted from the template generator, then I installed ts-jest with default ummodified options and use that as the test runner
